Make a menu:
- Use a rotary encoder to select different modes:
- - Discord {Mute, Deafen, Streamer Mode}
- - OBS {Change Scene, Show Camera}
- - Windows {Alt+Tab, Switch between desktops, open windows}

- Use a 16x2 LCD Display to show this. (Possibly replace the LED's with something on the screen?)
